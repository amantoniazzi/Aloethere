Aloe there comes in two colour schemes, visually flagging when your plants need watering.
Checkout the <a href="client/src/assets/mobile-homepage-green.png">homepage screen</a> and the <a href="client/src/assets/mobile-myplants-green.png">schedule screen</a> when all your plants are watered and happy.

## Tech stack

The app runs on an Express server, with a MongoDB (/Mongoose) database. On the frontend, it's built in React, with a mobile-first design. Assets courtesy of undraw.
