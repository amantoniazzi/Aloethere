Aloe there comes in two colour schemes, visually flagging when your plants need watering.
Checkout the <a href="client/src/assets/mobile-homepage-green.png">homepage screen</a> and the <a href="client/src/assets/mobile-myplants-green.png">schedule screen</a> when all your plants are watered and happy.
